# MSE

# Background

Marine fisheries management often employs total allowable catch (TAC) as a limit. The effectiveness of this approach hinges on monitoring capabilities and enforcement willingness. The actual catch might vary due to various factors, including economic incentives and multi-species TAC constraints.

# Importance

How closely a fishery sticks to a TAC is crucial for understanding population dynamics, future population projections, and management strategy evaluation (MSE). MSE often considers "implementation errors" â€” the difference between actual catch and the TAC.

# Methodology

We used hierarchical Bayesian models to study catch and TAC time series from 420 managed fish and invertebrate stocks, totaling 7,140 paired observations.
