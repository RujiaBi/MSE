## Background

Marine fisheries management often employs total allowable catch (TAC) as a limit. The effectiveness of this approach hinges on monitoring capabilities and enforcement willingness. The actual catch might vary due to various factors, including economic incentives and multi-species TAC constraints.

## Importance

How closely a fishery sticks to a TAC is crucial for understanding population dynamics, future population projections, and management strategy evaluation (MSE). MSE often considers "implementation errors" â€” the difference between actual catch and the TAC.

## Methodology

We used hierarchical Bayesian models to study catch and TAC time series from 420 managed fish and invertebrate stocks, totaling 7,140 paired observations.

## Key Findings

On average, catch was X% of TAC.
The range for each stock's average catch/TAC was X% to Y%.
Overall, the difference across all stocks (implementation error) fits a lognormal distribution (mean=0, sd=X).
Catch/TAC usually increased when TAC was reduced from the prior year, especially with decreases greater than 12%.
Reductions in TAC > 12% led to a 9X% likelihood of catch surpassing the TAC.

## Recommendation

For dynamic harvest strategy evaluations in MSEs, it's essential to factor in the implementation bias, especially during years with significant TAC alterations.
